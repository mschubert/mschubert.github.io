title: XML to tsv using XSLT
---

I'm working a lot with gene expression data, for instance from [The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA)](https://cancergenome.nih.gov/). One big challenge is to
investigate biological variation in different samples when it is potentially
maked by variation in the way the samples for collected, stored or processed.

When 20,000 genes are measured simultaneously, how do you know?. The way you
usually look at this is to perform some sort of dimensionality reduction on the
data set and look if they cluster by the batch they were collected or analysed
in. The TCGA assigns
[barcodes](https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/TCGA/TCGA+barcode) to their samples
that provide a lot of information on that like the Plate ID.

However, there is other information that is not in the barcode directly, like
the date the samples was shipped for sequencing. The [GDC Data
Portal](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov) provides additional information in the
*Biospecimen Supplement* files, but extracting this information is not trivial
for these XML files.

The information I was looking for was a table between the assigned barcode and
the shipment date, which were hidden in a structure like this:

{% highlight xml %}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<bio:tcga_bcr ...>
  <bio:patient>
    <bio:samples>
      <bio:sample>
        <bio:portions>
          <bio:portion>
            <bio:analytes>
              <bio:analyte>
                <bio:aliquots>
                  <bio:aliquot>
  <bio:bcr_aliquot_barcode>TCGA-x</bio:bcr_aliquot_barcode>
  <bio:bcr_year_of_shipment>2011<bio:year_of_shipment>
                  </bio:aliquot>
                </bio:aliquots>
              </bio:analyte>
            </bio:analytes>
          </bio:portion>
        </bio:portions>
      </bio:sample>
    </bio:samples>
  </bio:patient>
</bio:tcga_bcr>
{% endhighlight xml %}

One way to convert XML-formatted information into a table is to use
[XSLT](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSL_Transformation). There are nice
tutorials on [how to use it](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/tryxslt.asp?xmlfile=cdcatalog&xsltfile=cdcatalog),
but I did not know how to handle XML name spaces until recently, which the GDC
files contain.

The way to solve this is rather simple: look at all the `xmlns:` attributes in
the XML header that you are interested in, and add them to your
`xsl:stylesheet` tag. Then it's just a matter of referencing them correctly,
looping through your tags and printing out the values in a tab-separated way
with a newline at the end.

{% highlight xml %}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
    xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
    xmlns:bio="http://tcga.nci/bcr/xml/biospecimen/2.7"
    xmlns:admin="http://tcga.nci/bcr/xml/administration/2.7">
<xsl:output method="text" indent="no"/>
<xsl:strip-space elements="*"/>

<xsl:template match="/">

  <xsl:for-each select="bio:tcga_bcr/bio:patient/bio:samples/bio:sample">
  <xsl:for-each select="bio:portions/bio:portion">
  <xsl:for-each select="bio:analytes/bio:analyte">
  <xsl:for-each select="bio:aliquots/bio:aliquot">

    <xsl:value-of select="bio:bcr_aliquot_barcode"/>
    <xsl:text>&#x9;</xsl:text>
    <xsl:value-of select="bio:year_of_shipment"/>
    <xsl:text>-</xsl:text>
    <xsl:value-of select="bio:month_of_shipment"/>
    <xsl:text>&#xa;</xsl:text>

  </xsl:for-each>
  </xsl:for-each>
  </xsl:for-each>
  </xsl:for-each>

</xsl:template>
</xsl:stylesheet>
{% endhighlight xml %}

This is of course much less error-prone that using a regular expression. And
produces a table for a single file.

The data I downloaded from the GDC contained 500 files, so I used the `find`
command to execute the XSLT transformation on all of them:

{% highlight sh %}
tar -xf gdc_download_20170505.tar.gz
find gdc_download_20170505 -name "\*.xml" -exec xsltproc my.xslt {} \;
{% endhighlight sh %}

In the end, I got a table of a few thousand barcodes and the date they were shipped as tab-separated values.

| Barcode                      | Date    |
| ---------------------------- | ------- |
| TCGA-AA-A01C-01A-01D-A008-01 | 2010-03 |
| TCGA-AA-A01C-01A-01D-A00D-09 | 2010-03 |
| TCGA-AA-A01C-01A-01D-A00G-10 | 2010-04 |
| TCGA-AA-A01C-01A-01D-A077-02 | 2010-09 |
| ...                          | ...     |
