gsea methods should:

* not do a cutoff of DE (arbtiraryness introduced)
* report parametric p-values (I don't want to to 10^10 permutations)

not good are:

* piano (permutations)
* enrichr (set vs set)
* limma::roast (nrot set rotations and empirical)
* topGO (set vs set)
* goseq (set vs set)

maybe good are:

* gsva (does DE in their vignette as well)
* limma::camera
